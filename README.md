Designed specifically as a replacement of **NativeUI**, MenuAPI features performance improvements, **RedM** _and_ **FiveM** support, improved stability, better features, less bugs, full safezone alignment support for both left and right algined menus (FiveM only) and less (in my opinion) unnecessary features.

This has been coded from the ground up. Using decompiled scripts from GTA V & RedM to figure out what some undocumented natives were used for.

## Installation

_Note, this is only for resource developers, don't install this on your server manually if you're not making a resource with it._

You have 2 options:

1. Download the latest release zip and use the correct version (FiveM/RedM) for your resource. Simply include the DLL as a reference in your C# project and add `using MenuAPI;` to each file where you need to use MenuAPI.
2. Use the NuGet package, which can be found [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MenuAPI.FiveM/) for FiveM, and [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MenuAPI.RedM/) for RedM.

After doing either of the above and you're ready to build and publish your resource, add `files {'MenuAPI.dll'}` to your `fxmanifest.lua` file, and make sure that you include the `MenuAPI.dll` file in the folder of your resource.
